MISTer MultiComp 
================

Port of Grant Searle's MultiComp to the MiSTer

For convenience you can use the Multicomp FPGA - CP/M Demo Disk from Obsolescence Guaranteed:

After you have flash the CP/M Demo Disk to the SD Card you will have to use the secondary SD Card on the MiSTer on I/O Board:
